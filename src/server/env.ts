 * A minimal `.env` reader.
 *
 * Vite loads `.env` for the browser half, but the server half runs under `tsx`
 * and gets nothing — so `CONTEXT_DEV_API_KEY` would be undefined in the one
 * process that actually needs it. Node's own `--env-file` would work, but it
 * would have to be threaded through every way this server can be started (npm
 * script, smoke test, someone running tsx by hand), and each of those is a
 * place to forget it.
 *
 * Twenty lines here instead of a dependency and four launch-script edits.
 *
 * The file is resolved relative to THIS module rather than to cwd: the smoke
 * tests in scripts/ run from wherever the user happens to be, and a `.env` that
 * loads only when you start the server from the repo root is a trap.
